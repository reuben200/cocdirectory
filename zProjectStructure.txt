🕊️ Project Title:
==================================
Church of Christ Directory
==================================

🌍 Overview
=============
The Church of Christ Global Directory is a web platform designed to serve as a platform where individuals could easily visit to find a church of Christ near them, it is a searchable directory for congregations of the Church of Christ across different locations (countries, states, LGAs, etc.).

Each congregation can register, get verified, and gain access to a dashboard where they can manage their congregation’s information and post local events.

The frontend (built in React + TailwindCSS) will consume data from firebase.

🎯 Key Objectives
==================
Allow congregations to register and manage their profiles once verified.
Allow super admins to verify congregations and manage the directory.
Provide visitors with a searchable, filterable directory of all congregations.
Display local events from all congregations together in one unified event list.

🧩 User Roles
==============

-----------
Super Admin
-----------
Can approve or reject congregation registration requests.
Can update or remove congregation records.
Manages all data on the platform.

-------------------
Congregation Admin
-------------------
Registers congregation details.
Waits for verification before getting dashboard access.
Once verified, can edit congregation info and manage local events.

-------------
Visitor/User
-------------
Can view all congregations and events without login.
Can search/filter congregagtion by name, location, preacher, or keyword.

⚙️ Authentication & Verification Flow
======================================
A congregation admin signs up with congregation details and contact info.
A verification email is sent (email verification).
The super admin reviews and approves the congregation manually.
Once approved, the congregation admin gains dashboard access.

🧠 Additional Notes for the Backend Developer
----------------------------------------------
Use Django REST Framework (DRF) for API endpoints.
Ensure all responses follow the JSON formats above.
Use JWT Authentication (or session auth) for admin login.
Add CORS configuration to allow frontend access.
Include soft delete or active status flags for congregations and events.
File uploads (for congregation images) should return accessible URLs.
